# Projects - Barbora.ee in English language Search Functionality Testing

The e-commerce landscape is rapidly evolving, with customers increasingly relying on
online platforms to fulfill their shopping needs. As one of the leading online grocery stores in
Estonia, Barbora.ee aims to provide a seamless and efficient shopping experience. The search
functionality is a critical component of the website, enabling users to quickly find products, access
detailed information, and make purchases with ease.

The primary purpose of this project is to rigorously test the search functionality of the
Barbora.ee e-commerce website when accessed in the English language. The search feature is
integral to the user experience, allowing customers to locate products efficiently. By conducting a
comprehensive series of tests, I aim to identify any potential issues or limitations within the search
functionality, ensuring that it performs optimally under various conditions and scenarios.

Key objectives of the project include:
1. Accuracy and Relevance: Ensure that search results are accurate and relevant to the user's
query, providing the most appropriate products based on the search terms entered.
2. Usability and Accessibility: Confirm that the search bar is easily accessible and usable
across different devices and screen sizes, adhering to best practices in web accessibility.

Through meticulous testing, I aim to enhance the overall functionality and reliability of the
search feature on Barbora.ee, ultimately contributing to an improved shopping experience for all
users using the English language option. The results of this testing project will guide any necessary
adjustments or improvements, to providing a good online grocery shopping service.
